# ML-Final-Project
In this notebook, I am implementing a K-Means and DBSCAN algorithm to clustering region in North and South Sumatera based on the density transportation usage. I am using a manually K-Means algorithm, also DBSCAN NearestNeighbors library from scikit-learn to search the centroid point. The result from this research is North Sumatera have a denser transportation usage than South Sumatera which can be see in this notebook.
